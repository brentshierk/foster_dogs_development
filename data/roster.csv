I took two classes at the ASPCA and thought about volunteering there, but then we started looking into fostering dogs instead. We are excited about fostering a homeless dog because we feel like our rescue Riley, has become such a joy and a part of our family. We give him so much love and attention and feel like we have the capability to assist with other dogs' transitions into forever homes. We really feel lucky that we got Riley, and we also experienced and were able to work through his anxiety and his resource guarding that he did when he first came to us, and we want to help other dogs as well.

I became very interested in animal assisted therapy (AAT) and the many physical, mental, and socialization benefits that AAT provides to many different populations and worked with a man and his dog through an organization called Pet Partners, and he came to the senior center once a week with his dog and we had a group with the seniors. It was amazing to watch how much the dog and seniors connected.  We are both out during the day, Mon-Fri, for approximately 6-8 hours. Riley spends the day in our bedroom (we put a gate up at the bedroom door and leave the door open). He spends the day sleeping on our bed and playing with his toys. We are home each night all night, and are home all weekends. Riley stays with us all the time when we are not at work, so depending on the foster dog we are matched with, we are fine staying home with the dog, or taking him out with us, as we often take Riley to our friends' houses, dog parks in nyc, and also traveling to our parents' houses in Connecticut on the weekend so they can get out and run around in fields and at the local beach (beaches in Greenwich are dog friendly Dec-April every year and riley loves running on the beach).
